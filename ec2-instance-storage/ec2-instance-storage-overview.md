**What is an EBS Volume?**

* An **EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume** is a **Network Drive** you can attach to your instances while they run
* It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
* **They can only be mounted to one instance at a time** (at the CCP level)
* They are bound to a **specific AZ**
* Analogy: Think of them as  a "network USB stick"
