**EC2 Instance Store**

* EBS volumes are **network drives** with good but limited performance
* **If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store**
* Better I/O performance
* EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
* Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
* Risk of data loss if hardware fails
* Backups and replications are your responsability
